Let’s run a thought experiment. Suppose Facebook keeps a list of usernames. When someone tries to log in to Facebook, a search is done for their username. If their name is in the list of usernames, they can log in. People log in to Facebook pretty often, so there are a lot of searches through this list of usernames. Suppose Facebook uses binary search to search the list. Binary search needs random access—you need to be able to get to the middle of the list of usernames instantly. Knowing this, would you implement the list as an array or a linked list? 

Because binary search needs access to the middle list item, an array should be used.  A linked list provides only adjacent acceess, which means every list item before the middle element would also need to be accessed, when attempting to access the middle list item.
