Question:
People sign up for Facebook pretty often, too. Suppose you decided to use an array to 
store the list of users. What are the downsides of an array for inserts? In particular, 
suppose youâ€™re using binary search to search for logins. What happens when you add new 
users to an array? 

Answer:
Arrays are going to be slower with inserts compared to linked lists.  Inserting into the 
middle of an array requires shifting all elements after the insert location.  This could
mean that the entire array needs to be moved to another location in memory if there's 
not enough space in the current location.  When moved, if there's not enough contiguous
memory available to accommodate the array, the insert won't be possible.
